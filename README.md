# Randome Quote Generator V1.0

Random Quote Generator is a small and simple website that generates random quotes when the website is loaded or when you click on the [New Quote] button, also you can share the quotes on Twitter by clicking the [Tweet] button.
This website was created using Next.JS 13, ReactJS 18, Tailwind CSS v3.3.2, and the [Quotable Random Quotes API](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable).

You can try the demo on this [link](https://mellow-malabi-8c5708.netlify.app/)




## Getting Started
First, run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying pages/index.js. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in pages/api/hello.js.

The pages/api directory is mapped to /api/*. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) instead of React pages.

This project uses [next/font](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font
